Customizing code generation

  If you need to customize the generated code, simply provide custom templates to the JOMC Ant Tasks. This
  is done by adding a template artifact to the classpath of the tasks and setting the <<<templateProfile>>> parameter of
  the various tasks. As a starting point you can copy the default templates from the {{{${project.url}/../jomc-tools}JOMC Tools}}
  artifact from directory
  {{{${project.scm.url}/../jomc-tools/src/main/templates/org/jomc/tools/templates}org/jomc/tools/templates/jomc-java}}
  to a <<<org/jomc/tools/templates/sub-directory>>> of your template artifact.

  For example, copying the default templates to directory <<<org/jomc/tools/templates/custom-profile>>>, you need to set
  the <<<templateProfile>>> parameter to <<<custom-profile>>> and add your template artifact to the classpath of the
  tasks for the templates to be found.

  See class {{{${project.url}/../jomc-tools/apidocs/org/jomc/tools/SourceFileProcessor.html}SourceFileProcessor}} for
  details, especially the {{{${project.url}/../jomc-tools/apidocs/org/jomc/tools/JomcTool.html#getVelocityTemplate(java.lang.String)}getVelocityTemplate}}
  method and the {{{${project.url}/../jomc-tools/apidocs/org/jomc/tools/SourceFileProcessor.html#getSourceFilesType(org.jomc.model.Specification)}getSourceFilesType}}
  methods.
