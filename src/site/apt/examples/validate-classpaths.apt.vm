Validating a project's main classpath

  If you need to validate a project's main classpath, just add the <<<validate-main-classpath>>> goal to the
  <<<pom.xml>>>.

<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.jomc</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-jomc-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>default-main</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>validate-main-classpath</goal>
