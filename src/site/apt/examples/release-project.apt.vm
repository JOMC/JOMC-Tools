Releasing a project

  If you need to perform a release of a project using the JOMC Plugin, just instruct the plugin to not update any source
  code files during the build. This is done by setting the <<<jomc.sourceProcessing>>> property to <<<false>>>.
  To minimize the number of <<<-D>>> options, a profile can be added to the local Maven <<<settings.xml>>> file or to
  your <<<pom.xml>>>.

mvn ... -Djomc.verbose=true -Djomc.sourceProcessing=false
