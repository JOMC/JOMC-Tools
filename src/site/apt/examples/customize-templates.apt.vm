Customizing code generation

  If you need to customize the generated code, simply provide custom templates to the JOMC Plugin. This is done by
  adding a template artifact as a plugin dependency and setting the <<templateProfile>> parameter of the JOMC Plugin.
  As a starting point you can copy the default templates from the {{{./../../jomc-tools}JOMC Tools}} artifact from
  directory <<org/jomc/tools/templates/jomc-java>> to a <<org/jomc/tools/templates/sub-directory>> of your template
  artifact.

  For example, copying the default templates to directory <<org/jomc/tools/templates/custom-profile>>, you need to set
  the <<templateProfile>> parameter to <<custom-profile>> and add your template artifact as a plugin dependency for the
  templates to be found.

  See class {{{./../../jomc-tools/apidocs/org/jomc/tools/SourceFileProcessor.html}SourceFileProcessor}} for details,
  especially the {{{./../../jomc-tools/apidocs/org/jomc/tools/JomcTool.html#getVelocityTemplate(java.lang.String)}getVelocityTemplate}}
  method and the {{{./../../jomc-tools/apidocs/org/jomc/tools/SourceFileProcessor.html#getSourceFileType(org.jomc.model.Specification)}getSourceFileType}}
  methods.
