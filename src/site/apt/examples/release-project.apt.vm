Releasing a project

  If you need to perform a release of a project using the JOMC Plugin, just instruct the plugin to not update any source
  code files during the build. This is most commonly done by adding a corresponding release profile to your
  <<<pom.xml>>>.

+-----------------+
<project>
  ...
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>jomc-release</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>false</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <jomc.verbose>true</jomc.verbose>
        <jomc.sourceProcessing>false</jomc.sourceProcessing>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  ...
</project>
